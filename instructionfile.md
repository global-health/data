## Network analysis

Network analysis consists of a network of IOs and self-declared practices involving another IO. This information can be found in the document data3.csv, where "Source" is the IO declaring the practice, "Year" the year of the report, "Target" the IO concerned by the declaration and "Weight" the number of times this practice takes place in the reporting year. 
This CSV file can be imported into Gephi, an open source network visualization program, specifying that it is the Edges File.
